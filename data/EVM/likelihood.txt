Use grid-search over a range of K’s, using as an objective function cross-validated likelihood.

That is, they can use likelihood models of the form p(x t:t+l |z t = k, d t = l), which generate l correlated observations if the duration in state k is for l time steps.

It makes more sense to try to approximate the smoothed distribution rather than the backwards
likelihood term.

The gradient of the log likelihood can be rewritten as the expected feature vector according
to the empirical distribution minus the model’s expectation of the feature vector.

We call this algorithm stochastic maximum likelihood or SML.

Nevertheless, coordinate descent can be slow. An alternative method is to update all the
parameters at once, by simply following the gradient of the likelihood.
