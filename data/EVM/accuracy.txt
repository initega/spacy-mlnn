If we have a separate test set, we can evaluate performance on this, in order to estimate the accuracy of our method.

The accuracy of an MC approximation increases with sample size.

Accuracy of Monte Carlo approximation

where K is chosen based on some tradeoff between accuracy and complexity.

In high dimensional problems, we might prefer a method that only depends on a subset of the features, for reasons of accuracy and interpretability.

In machine learning, we often care more about predictive accuracy than in interpreting the
parameters of our models.

However, accuracy is not the only important factor when choosing a method.
