From this table, we can compute the true positive rate (TPR), also known as the sensitivity,
recall or hit rate.

Precision measures what fraction of our detections are actually
positive, and recall measures what fraction of the positives we actually detected.

Alternatively, one can quote the precision for a fixed recall level, such as the precision of the first K = 10 entities.

The method had a precision of 66% when the recall was set to 10%; while low, this is substantially more than rival variable-selection methods, such as lasso and elastic net, which were only slightly above
chance.
