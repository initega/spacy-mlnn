This review article aims to provide an overview of the ways in which techniques from artificial
intelligence can be usefully employed in bioinformatics, both for modelling biological data
and for making new discoveries.

Artificial intelligence (AI) has increasingly gained attention in bioinformatics research and
computational molecular biology.

In this review, the theory and main principles of the SVM approach are
outlined, and successful applications in traditional areas of bioinformatics research.

Soft computing is make several latent in bioinformatics, especially by generating low-cost,
low precision (approximate), good solutions. 

It has a wide spectrum of applications such as natural language processing, search engines, medical diagnosis, bioinformatics and more.
