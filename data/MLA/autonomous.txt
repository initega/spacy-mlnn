Two branches of the trend towards" agents" that are gaining currency are interface agents,
software that actively assists a user in operating an interactive interface, and autonomous
agents, software that takes action without user intervention and operates concurrently.

One category of research in Artificial Life is concerned with modeling and building so-called
adaptive autonomous agents.

This book deals with an important topic in distributed AI: the coordination of autonomous
agents' activities.

Developing autonomous or driver-assistance systems for complex urban traffic poses new algorithmic and system-architecture challenges.

An autonomous floor-cleaning robot comprises a self-adjusting cleaning head subsystem
that includes a dual-stage brush assembly having counter-rotating, asymmetric brushes and
an adjacent, but independent, vacuum assembly.

AAFID was the first architecture that proposed the use of autonomous
agents for doing intrusion detection.
