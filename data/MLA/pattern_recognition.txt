This paper presents an electromyographic (EMG) pattern recognition method to identify
motion commands for the control of a prosthetic arm by evidence accumulation based on
artificial intelligence with multiple parameters.

The techniques may be classified broadly into two categoriesâ€”the conventional pattern recognition approach and the artificial intelligence (AI) based approach. 

We sought to test the hypothesis that a novel 2-dimensional echocardiographic
image analysis system using artificial intelligence-learned pattern recognition can rapidly
and reproducibly calculate ejection fraction (EF).

This paper reports the use of a variety of pattern recognition techniques, such as the
learning machine and the Fisher discriminant.

However, my focus will not be on these types of pattern-recognition problems.
