A simple example of a non-parametric classifier is the K nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier.

A KNN classifier with K = 1 induces a Voronoi tessellation of the points.

The KNN classifier is simple and can work quite well, provided it is given a good distance metric and has enough labeled training data.

However, the main problem with KNN classifiers is that they do not work well with high
dimensional inputs.

Choosing K for a KNN classifier is a special case of a more general problem known as model
selection.
