However, in general, interpreting latent variable models is fraught
with difficulties, as we discuss in Section 12.1.3.

Now consider latent variable models of the form z i → x i ← θ.

A topic model is a latent variable model for text documents and other forms of discrete data.

If density estimation is our only goal, it is worth considering whether it would be more
appropriate to learn a latent variable model, which can capture correlation between the visible
variables via a set of latent common causes.

In this chapter, we are concerned with latent variable models for discrete data, such as bit vectors, sequences of categorical variables, count vectors, graph structures, relational data, etc.

Many of the models we have looked at in this book have a simple two-layer architecture of
the form z → y for unsupervised latent variable models, or x → y for supervised models.
