In astronomy, the autoclass system (Cheeseman et al. 1988) discovered a new type of star,
based on clustering astrophysical measurements.

This procedure is called soft clustering, and is identical to the computations performed when
using a generative classifier.

We can represent the amount of uncertainty in the cluster assignment by using 1 âˆ’ max k r ik .
Assuming this is small, it may be reasonable to compute a hard clustering using the MAP
estimate.

As an example of clustering binary data, consider a binarized version of the MNIST handwrit-
ten digit dataset.

After 20 iterations, the algorithm has converged on a good clustering.

Clustering is an unsupervised task that may not yield a representation that is useful for prediction.
