The main application of Hopfield networks is as an associative memory or content ad-
dressable memory.

A Hopfield network (Hopfield 1982) is a fully connected Ising model with a symmetric weight
matrix, W = W T .

A large number of iterations and oscillations are those of the major concern in solving the
economic load dispatch problem using the Hopfield neural network.

This paper formulates and studies a model of delayed impulsive Hopfield neural networks.

In this paper, some novel criteria for the global robust stability of a class of interval Hopfield neural networks with constant delays are given. 

A modified Hopfield neural network model for regularized image restoration is presented.
