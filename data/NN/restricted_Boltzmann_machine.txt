Recent developments have demonstrated the capacity of restricted Boltzmann machines
(RBM) to be powerful generative models, able to extract useful features from input data or
construct deep artificial neural networks.

The architecture is a continuous restricted Boltzmann machine, with one step of Gibbs sampling, to minimise contrastive divergence

We introduce the spike and slab Restricted Boltzmann Machine, characterized by having
both a real-valued vector, the slab, and a binary variable, the spike, associated with each
unit in the hidden layer.

The restricted Boltzmann machine is a graphical model for binary random variables.

Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) has shown great effectiveness in document
modeling.
