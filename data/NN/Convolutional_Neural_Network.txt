We trained a large, deep convolutional neural network to classify the 1.3 million high-
resolution images in the LSVRC-2010 ImageNet training set into the 1000 different classes. 

The ability to accurately represent sentences is central to language understanding. We
describe a convolutional architecture dubbed the Dynamic Convolutional Neural Network
(DCNN) that we adopt for the semantic modelling of sentences.

We propose two efficient approximations to standard convolutional neural networks: Binary-
Weight-Networks and XNOR-Networks.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been recently employed to solve problems
from both the computer vision and medical image analysis fields.

We present a fast, fully parameterizable GPU implementation of Convolutional Neural
Network variants.
