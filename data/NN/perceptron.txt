We introduced a multilayer perceptron neural network (MLPNN) based classification model
as a diagnostic decision support mechanism in the epilepsy treatment.

This study compares the performance of multilayer perceptron neural networks.

It is found to relax exponentially towards the perceptron of optimal stability using the concept of adaptive learning.

The perceptron: a probabilistic model for information storage and organization in the brain.

Perceptron training is widely applied in the natural language processing community for
learning complex structured models.
