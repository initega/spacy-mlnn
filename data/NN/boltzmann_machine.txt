 
Part II addresses the problem of designing parallel annealing algorithms on the basis of Boltzmann machines.

I present a mean-field theory for Boltzmann machine learning, derived by employing
Thouless-Anderson-Palmer free energy formalism to a full extent. 

We describe a model based on a Boltzmann machine with third-order connections that can
learn how to accumulate information about a shape over several fixations. 

Inspired by the success of Boltzmann machines based on classical Boltzmann distribution.

Paining a Boltzmann machine with hidden units is appropriately treated in information
geometry using the information divergence and the technique of alternating minimization.
