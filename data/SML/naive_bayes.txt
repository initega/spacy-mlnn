However, even if the naive Bayes assumption is not true, it oftenresults in classifiers that work well

We now discuss how to “train” a naive Bayes classifier.

If the sample size N is very small, which model (naive Bayes or full) is likely to give lower test set error, and why?

Hence in a naive Bayes classifier, we can simply ignore missing features at test time.

So observing a root node separates its children (as in a naive Bayes classifier.

On the left we show a naive Bayes classifier that has been “unrolled” for D features.
