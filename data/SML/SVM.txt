In fact, many popular machine learning methods — such as support vector machines.

Another very popular approach to creating a sparse kernel machine is to use a support
vector machine or SVM.

SVM regression with C = 1/λ chosen by cross validation.

This combination of the kernel trick plus a modified loss function is known as a support vector machine or SVM.

It is possible to obtain sparse, probabilistic, multi-class kernel-based classifiers, which work as well or better than SVMs.
