The technique known as random forests (Breiman 2001a) tries to decorrelate the base
learners by learning trees based on a randomly chosen subset of input variables, as well as a
randomly chosen subset of data cases.

Note that the cost of these sampling-based Bayesian methods is comparable to the sampling-based random forest method.

The second best method was random forests, invented by Breiman.

In second place are either random forests or boosted MLPs, depending
on the preprocessing.
