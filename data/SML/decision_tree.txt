Inputs in decision trees is to look for a series of ”backup” variables, which can induce a similar partition to the chosen variable at any given split.

This can be thought of as a probabilistic decision tree of depth 2, since we recursively partition the space, and apply a different expert to each partition.

By contrast, in a standard decision tree, predictions are made only based on the model in the corresponding leaf.

The standard heuristic for handling missing inputs in decision trees is to look for a series of ”backup” variables.
