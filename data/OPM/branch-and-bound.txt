A stochastic branch and bound method for solving stochastic global optimization problems is
proposed.

The idea to construct and solve entirely polyhedral-based relaxations in the context of
branch-and-bound for global optimization was first proposed and analyzed by Taw- armalani
and Sahinidis.

The algorithm is of the branch-and-bound type, and differs from previous interactive algorithms in several ways. 

This paper investigates the influence of the interval subdivision selection rule on the
convergence of interval branch-and-bound algorithms for global optimization.

A general branch-and-bound conceptual scheme for global optimization is presented that
includes along with previous branch-and-bound approaches also grid-search techniques.
