In addition, it uses a form of beam search to explore multiple
paths through the lattice at once.

A star search and beam search to quickly find an approximate MAP estimate.

Mansinghka et al. 2007 discusses how to fit a DPMM online using particle filtering, which is a like a stochastic version of beam search.
