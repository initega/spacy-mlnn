The first term is just the normalization constant, required to ensure the distribution sums to 1.

The normalization constant only exists (and hence the pdf is only well defined) if ν > D − 1.

So assuming the relevant normalization constants are tractable, we have an easy way to compute
the marginal likelihood.

Since all the potentials are locally normalized, since they are CPDs, there is no need for a
global normalization constant, so Z = 1.

Hence satsifying normalization and local consistency is enough to define a valid distribution for any tree. Hence μ ∈ M(T ) as well.
