This article reviews the evaluation and optimization of the preprocessing steps for blood-
oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).

However, there is little consensus on the optimal choice of data preprocessing steps to minimize these effects.

It has been established thatthe chosen preprocessing steps (or “pipeline”) may significantly affect fMRI results.

The automated analysis pipeline comprises data import, normalization, replica merging, quality
diagnostics and data export. 

The apparatus is formed as a pipeline having a translation and scaling section,

To address these challenges, we developed an automated software pipeline, called
Rnnotator.
