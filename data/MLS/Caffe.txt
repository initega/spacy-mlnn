We will use some Python code and a popular open source deep learning framework called Caffe to build the classifier.

Use tail -f model_1_train.log to view Caffe's progress.

The caffe "tools/extra/parse_log.sh" file requires a small change to use on OS X.

I followed Caffe's tutorial on LeNet MNIST, using GPU, and it worked great. 

Alternatively, Caffe has built in a function called iter_size.

Caffe estimates the gradient (more accurately), weights are updated, and the process continues.

 The feature iter_size is a Caffe function per se, but you are correct that it is an option that you set in the solver protobuf file.
