I’m not saying that you don’t need to understand a bit of TensorFlow for certain applications.

TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. It’s a comprehensive and flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries and other resources that provide workflows with high-level APIs. 

TensorFlow provides both high-level and low-level APIs.

Tensorflow’s eager execution allows for immediate iteration along with intuitive debugging.

TensorFlow is designed for machine learning applications.
