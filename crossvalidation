Entities in 'If we have a separate test set we can evaluate performance on this in order to estimate the accuracy of our method.
A simple but popular solution to this is to use cross validation (CV). The idea is simple: we split the training data into K folds; then for each fold k ∈ {1 . . .  K} we train on all the folds but the k’th and test on the k’th in a round-robin fashion
Use grid-search over a range of K’s using as an objective function cross-validated likelihood.
From this table we can compute the true positive rate (TPR) also known as the sensitivity, recall or hit rate.

This is likely to be much faster than cross validation especially if we have many hyper-parameters (e.g. as in ARD).
Nevertheless coordinate descent can be slow. An alternative method is to update all the parameters at once by simply following the gradient of the likelihood.
The method had a precision of 66% when the recall was set to 10%; while low this is substantially more than rival variable-selection methods such as lasso and elastic net which were only slightly above chance.
