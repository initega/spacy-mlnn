Entities in 'If we have a separate test set we can evaluate performance on this in order to estimate the accuracy of our method.
A simple but popular solution to this is to use cross validation (CV). The idea is simple: we split the training data into K folds; then for each fold k ∈ {1 . . .  K} we train on all the folds but the k’th and test on the k’th in a round-robin fashion
Use grid-search over a range of K’s using as an objective function cross-validated likelihood.
From this table we can compute the true positive rate (TPR) also known as the sensitivity, recall or hit rate.
This week I read through a history of everything I've said to Alexa and it felt a little bit like reading an old diary.
NLP has been considered a subdiscipline of Artificial Intelligence.
Two branches of the trend towards "agents" that are gaining currency are interface agents software that actively assists a user in operating an interactive interface and autonomous agents software that takes action without user intervention and operates concurrently.

However even if the naive Bayes assumption is not true it oftenresults in classifiers that work well
The technique known as random forests (Breiman 2001a) tries to decorrelate the base learners by learning trees based on a randomly chosen subset of input variables as well as a randomly chosen subset of data cases.
A simple example of a non-parametric classifier is the K nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier.
